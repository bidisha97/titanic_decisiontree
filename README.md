# titanic_decisiontree
These dataset has been cleaned before importing on the notebook.
Only dicision tree algorithm is used to score the model.
The main objective is to create decision tree image using graphviz.
Here, we have achieved a score of 88%.
We taken account for only gender male as the root node and created two parent node of p-class_3 and fare.
While creating the image we have taken max_depth as 2.
Less is the Gini Impurity more homogenous nodes we can get.
